Music-Chord-Namer version 0.01
==============================

Give it notes, it names the chord.

Music::Chord::Namer optionally exports one sub, chordname, which accepts some notes as either a string
or a list and returns the best chord name it can think of.

chordname() accepts either a string of notes such as "C Eb G A#" or a list of notes such as
qw/Ab Bb F Bb D/.  In a scalar context it returns the best name it could think of to describe the 
chord made from the notes you gave it.  In an array context it returns all of the names it thought
of, sorted from best to worst (shortest to longest!)
